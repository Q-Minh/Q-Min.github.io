Over the years, my appreciation towards mathematics has kept growing into what could now be described as awe. Thanks to my research into physics based animation, I was able to immerse myself in topics such as matrix computations, numerical partial differential equations, optimization, graph theory, variational calculus, and many others. 

While I wouldn't dare claim to be an expert in these topics, I believe that I've reached a level of understanding that allows me to intuitively describe them. There is quite a vast body of literature on mathematics that has accumulated since thousands of years ago that venture deep into various topics. Hence, I'll instead try to share intuitive, hopefully practical, and easy to digest material on topics that I think would benefit from such a treatment.
