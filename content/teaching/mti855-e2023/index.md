Description
------
This course introduces students to numerical techniques for physics-based animation in real-time applications, such as video games and virtual reality. The main objective of this course is to develop an understanding of the fundamental techniques used for physics-based animation.

By the end of the course, students will be able to 
- understand the fundamental principles of modeling and simulating physical environments, including soft and rigid bodies, fluids, and 3D characters
- create their own computer graphics applications that use physical simulation as a central element
- analyze the numerical methods used for physical simulations and assess their impact on real-time requirements and simulation accuracy.

Topics covered include, among others 
- numerical integration
- numerical analysis of physical systems
- particle dynamics
- mass-spring systems
- constrained rigid body dynamics
- constraint stabilization
- collision detection
- contact
- elastic body deformations
- fluid simulation
- control of 3D physical characters.
